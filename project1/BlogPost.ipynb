    "# Airbnb meaning – What does it stands for?\n",
    "Airbnb stands for Air Bed and Breakfast, a fairly simple meaning. But what’s the Air part all about? You would think it relates to flying up in the air right? Not even close!\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in 2007, cash strapped Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky were living in San Francisco. Every year a design conference came to town, filling every hotel room he brink. Being savvy entrepreneurs, they thought to themselves “why not rent out our floor space in our lounge room?”.\n",
    "\n",
    "So they went out and purchased 3 air beds. They blew them up and advertised them on their website which they called Airbed and Breakfast. A week later they had their first guests at $80 a night.\n",
