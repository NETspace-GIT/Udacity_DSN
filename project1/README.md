Link to the blog post can be find at: [Project 01 - Write a Data Science Blog Post](https://github.com/NETspace-GIT/Udacity_DSN/blob/main/project1/Seattle_Airbnb_Analysis.ipynb)

The objective of this project is to write a data science blog post on Medium. We have investigated and analysed the bookings on Airbnb platform on the city of Seattle(WA). The dataset can be found at:


*   [Seattle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)

During this analysis, we are trying mainly to answer following three questions:

*   (1) What are the host profiles and how we can better understand them?
*   (2) Looking at the prices and how prices are distributed based on the different types and hosts?
*   (3) What customer reviews can tell us regarding to properties in this city?

## Instalation

There's no need to install any filles to check the code and the results at the jupyter notebook file (.ipynb)

## Libraries

Following libraries are used during this project: 

*   PanDas
*   Seaborn 
*   Numpy
*   Locale

## Files in the repository

*   *listings.csv* - .csv file contatining the data from the Airbnb listed properties in Seattle(WA);
*   *Seattle_Airbnb_Analysis.ipynb* - Jupyter notebook containing the code and the results of the analysis;

## Analysis:

###   Here are the subjects mainly we try to do analysis and investigate at this project?

*   ** Analyzing Hosts and differnt profiles**

*   ** Pricing Analysis**

*   ** Customer experience analysis**

###  Conclusion

From a guest point of view, it's possible to say that Seattle is more likely to provide a better Airbnb experience, as we have seen that:

*   The hosts seem to be thoughful and flexible, besides the fact of being close to help out with any problems;
*   Prices for one night booking are reasonable and close for almost all the property types, but vehicles (Boats and Camper/RVs);
*   Booking reviews for all the types of properties are acceptable with high average value;
